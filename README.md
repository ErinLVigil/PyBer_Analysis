# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview
  PyBer is a ride-sharing organization looking to better understand the markets in which they operate and the potential profitability of these markets. There are a few different data points we can use to look at the markets, however, this part of the project is focused on understanding the Average Fares per Rider and Average Fares per Driver by market type and then looking at the total revenue in fares from these markets over a span of 4 months. In understanding the difference in market types, Pyber can understand how to better allocate resources and make decisions that could range from increasing fares and profitablity in lagging markets, or concentrating efforts only on high revenue markets.
  
  ## Results
  
  ### Ride Sharing Summary
  
The first part of our analysis was to look at the summary information for Pyber. The city data file contained each city name, type of city, and count of drivers. This is only useful to look at the number of drivers in each type of market. Our rider data only contained specific trip information such as the date, city, and fare amount. Merging these files enables the ability to look at the fares by market type, driver count and rider count in these markets.  
    The trickiest part of this analysis was counting the drivers. In the merged file, we ended up overstating the drivers because the entire driver count for a city was added in each line where a city appeared. Summing up each city by market type double and triple counted the driver. We had to get the driver count from the city data file instead. 
    Once the counts were established, we could then easily group the data by market type and realize that there were significantly more riders in the Urban market than the Rural market. More than ten times the number of drivers means more demand, and in turn, likely more supply. This is evidenced by the 30 fold increase in drivers between the Rural and Urabn markets. The interesting thing is that while there are almost 30 times as many drivers available in the Urban market versus the Rural market, the total fares is only higher by a factor of ten mirroring the rider count. 30 times higher supply yet the demand seems to only be 10 times as high. The suburban market seems fall somewhere in between these two extremes.
    The next logical question that poses is the average fares in these markets for riders and drivers. Given the analysis in the last step, we can only assume the average fare per driver will be highest in the Rural market and lower in the Suburban market and even lower in the urban market. The average fare per rider is also higher in the rural market by about 40% over the lowest market, the Urban market. This makes sense given that fares are usually calculated by total distance and rural markets would likely have riders traveling greater distances over a densly packet urban city with likely shorter distances.

### Charted Fares by Market type and week

  The second part of the analysis produced a way to visualize and analyze the total fares by market type on a weekly basis over the span of a few months. The visualization would allow us not only to see the difference over time in a market, but also compare what was going on at the same time in other markets to understand if there was any correlation between markets and time. 
   To complete this analysis, it was necessary to group all of our merged data by market type and then pivot the table by the date field. The date field in a csv was just an object, so had to be converted into a time stamp. The timestamp was detailed down to the minutes and seconds. This is too detailed to allow any sort of trend analysis and then needs to be consolidated to weeks. 
   Once we had  the data grouped and consolidated, we could visualize the data into a multi-line chart. The matplot lib fivethirtyeight style in matplot lib is perfect for this type of analysis to clearly show us the difference in markets.

Looking at this chart, it is no surprise that the Urban fares are significantly the highest, with Suburban fares in the middle and rural fares on the bottom. There appears to be a week in the end of February that was the high or near high for each of the markets. This could be a coincidence or correlated to an event when people would be going out or a weather event. Each market varies only within its range of about 500-600 dollars and we so no crossover in these lines. Suburban markets increased significantly the last few weeks in April while Rural and Urban markets saw decline over that same time.

## Summary

  Just looking at a per fare basis, Rural Markets are incredibly appealing and attractive. If Pyber makes a percentage of the fare, higher fares are appealing. However, if Pyber makes a fixed fee per fare, then markets with more drivers and more trips are much more attractive. Urban markets have the highest number of trips and highest overall fare summaries week over week. If it is a combination of factors, fixed fee plus percentage of trips, then suburban markets offer a nice compromise between those two factors. Without knowledge of the fee structure and profit metrics, we can make some assumptions and come to some conclusions. 
  Assuming Pyber uses a multi factor approach to profitability that includes total fare plus number of fares I would suggest the following actions to test one of the 3 levers we have to pull in each market, namely, demand, supply, or price. 
  
  1. Run a campaign to increase drivers in rural markets by 10%. We do not know if all demand is serviced by the number of drivers available. Typically wait times are longer in rural markets due to limited driver supply and distance a driver travels to pick up a fare. This may result in loss of fares by riders picking alternate methods. If we increase the number of drivers by 8, a little more than 10%, and the average fare per ride($35) and average number of rides per driver holds steady(1.6), then we could possibly increase overall fare totals. If the increase isa lot more than 10%, then we have potential to grow this market from underserved demand. If the increase is around 10% or less, then we can consider leaving this market as is since demand is met and changing our pricing model in this region is risky in rurual areas that are typically more sensitive to price pressure.
  2. Run a promotion in the suburban markets with a 10% discount on fares. This would still make each fare more profitable on per fare basis than the urban market. ($27.87 vs $24.93) Again, we would watch to see if this increased the total number of trips by more or less than 10% in price. Here, we are testing the price elasticity in the suburban market. This market has a fair number of trips and a higher fare per ride than the urban market. We could then test if there is marketshare left in the suburban cities that is not being captured. It seems like April might be a good time for this promotion since more people in the suburban markets are using ride-sharing possibly due to end of school year activities or nicer weather and things to do. We'd have to look at the markets a bit more and a few more factores to determine the time frame. It is possible that no amount of price break or supply would make a difference in suburban markets could influence demand that is simply not there, again making some fairly large assumptions grounded in unsubstantiated claims.
  3. Lastly, to address possible growth in the urban market, the trend line is a little bit more stable than the other markets over time. The fare per ride is much lower, so it might make sense to play with the pricing model in this market as well. If we increase the fares by 5%, it is roughly only $1.25 per ride, we increase overall fare totals by about $2030. This is roughly 50% of the total of the rurual market, so small changes add up much faster in larger markets. Urban markets are historically less price sensitive.

The key for the company is pick the action that has the biggest revenue return without sacrificing profitability. The approach above lets Pyber test a few of the levers in diifferent markets  to uncover which initiative could pay off the biggest if scaled up. Scaling one of these initiatives would be Phase 2 of this plan. I'm also assuming there is a lot of competition in this market and Pyber has strong brand equity. Drastic measures could sacrifice brand equity if they fail miserably allowing competition to creep in. This is a slower and sneakier approach to figure out where Pyber can capture more marketshare and what time of year to impliment each initiative without losing its customer base to competition.
